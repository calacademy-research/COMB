## Function to change multiple parts about the function in one area
## Here are the things that it will (ideally) be able to do:
## Slice ARU data to desired amount
## Slice PC data to desired amount
## Eliminate (knockout) certain priors and parts of the model
## File aggregation amount
## Some of this really should be done in model_read_lib.R but that is too fancy for me 
## Slicing data should (and will) be done in that lib

# Let's just start with eliminating a parameter in the model
