## Guidelines

### Formatting

[styler](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/) is an R code
formatter. For usage instructions follow the link.

Before making a pull request containing .R source files, it is strongly
recommended to style all that have changed under styler's default settings, as
this can meaningfully reduce the rate of merge conflicts due to formatting.
(Differences due to editor handling of tab expansion and trailing whitespace are
the most common.)
